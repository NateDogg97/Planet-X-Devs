# Homepage Performance Optimization Checklist

## Performance Analysis and Baseline

### Task 1: Measure Current Performance
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit on homepage and save baseline scores
- [ ] Document current Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- [ ] Measure current bundle size with `npm run build`
- [ ] Identify largest JavaScript chunks in build output
- [ ] Take screenshots of bundle analyzer output

### Task 2: Identify Performance Bottlenecks
- [ ] List all components used on homepage
- [ ] Identify components with heavy animations
- [ ] Find components that could be static HTML
- [ ] List all external dependencies (framer-motion, react-countup, swiper)
- [ ] Check for unnecessary re-renders in React DevTools

## Quick Wins - High Impact Low Effort

### Task 3: Optimize Floating Planets Performance
- [ ] Open `src/components/ui/FloatingPlanet.tsx`
- [ ] Add initial opacity: 0 to planet styles
- [ ] Implement CSS fade-in animation (opacity 0 to 1)
- [ ] Make component non-render-blocking using dynamic import in Hero
- [ ] Add animation delay for staggered planet appearance
- [ ] Test that planets animate in smoothly without blocking render

### Task 4: Optimize StarField Component
- [ ] Open `src/components/ui/StarField.tsx`
- [ ] Reduce number of stars from 50 to 25
- [ ] Add `will-change: auto` after animation completes
- [ ] Implement cleanup for animation end
- [ ] Test performance impact

### Task 5: Lazy Load Testimonial Carousel
- [ ] Import `dynamic` from 'next/dynamic' in homepage
- [ ] Convert TestimonialCarousel to dynamic import with `ssr: false`
- [ ] Add loading skeleton while carousel loads
- [ ] Verify carousel still works after change
- [ ] Measure performance improvement

## Bundle Size Reduction

### Task 6: Analyze Framer Motion Usage
- [ ] Check if framer-motion is only used in Hero component
- [ ] List all animations currently using framer-motion
- [ ] Create CSS-only alternatives for simple animations
- [ ] Test if hero text animation can use CSS keyframes
- [ ] Consider removing framer-motion if possible

### Task 7: Optimize CountUp Component
- [ ] Check where CountUp is used (just Hero stats)
- [ ] Create lightweight alternative using CSS counter
- [ ] Or implement simple vanilla JS counter
- [ ] Remove react-countup dependency if successful
- [ ] Test that number animations still work

### Task 8: Remove Unused Swiper
- [ ] Confirm Swiper is not used on homepage
- [ ] Check if used on any other pages
- [ ] Remove import from package.json if unused
- [ ] Run `npm uninstall swiper` if confirmed unused
- [ ] Rebuild and check bundle size reduction

## Component Optimization

### Task 9: Convert Benefits Section to Static HTML
- [ ] Open homepage benefits section
- [ ] Copy JSX content from the section
- [ ] Remove component abstraction, use inline JSX
- [ ] Keep hover animations but make CSS-only
- [ ] Test that section still displays correctly

### Task 10: Optimize Service Cards Grid
- [ ] Limit homepage to show only 3 service cards
- [ ] Remove animation from cards below the fold
- [ ] Implement intersection observer for cards 4-6
- [ ] Add loading="lazy" to any images
- [ ] Verify cards still animate on scroll

### Task 11: Simplify Process Timeline
- [ ] Open ProcessTimeline component
- [ ] Remove complex particle animation if present
- [ ] Keep only the line drawing animation
- [ ] Reduce JavaScript logic for animations
- [ ] Test timeline still looks professional

## Image and Asset Optimization

### Task 12: Optimize Icon Components
- [ ] Check if all icons are being used
- [ ] Remove unused icon definitions
- [ ] Consider icon sprite sheet approach
- [ ] Ensure icons use minimal SVG paths
- [ ] Test all icons still display correctly

### Task 13: Implement Progressive Enhancement
- [ ] Add `motion-reduce:animate-none` to all animations
- [ ] Ensure site works with JavaScript disabled
- [ ] Add proper `will-change` usage (sparingly)
- [ ] Remove `will-change` after animations complete
- [ ] Test with prefers-reduced-motion enabled

## Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

### Task 14: Implement Route-Based Code Splitting
- [ ] Ensure each page only loads its required components
- [ ] Check that shared components are in a common chunk
- [ ] Verify services page doesn't load homepage components
- [ ] Test navigation between pages is smooth
- [ ] Measure JavaScript downloaded per route

### Task 15: Optimize Component Imports
- [ ] Review all imports in homepage
- [ ] Remove any unused imports
- [ ] Convert heavy components to dynamic imports
- [ ] Add proper loading states for dynamic components
- [ ] Verify no functionality is broken

## Structural Optimizations

### Task 16: Convert Static Sections
- [ ] Identify sections with no interactivity
- [ ] Convert "Partnership Section" to static HTML
- [ ] Convert footer links to static HTML
- [ ] Remove unnecessary wrapper components
- [ ] Test all sections still display correctly

### Task 17: Optimize React Component Tree
- [ ] Reduce component nesting depth
- [ ] Combine small components that aren't reused
- [ ] Remove unnecessary Fragment wrappers
- [ ] Implement React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Test for any visual regressions

## Final Optimization and Testing

### Task 18: Implement Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Add performance marks for key interactions
- [ ] Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
- [ ] Set up performance budgets
- [ ] Add alerts for performance regressions
- [ ] Document performance targets

### Task 19: Production Build Optimization
- [ ] Enable Next.js production optimizations
- [ ] Implement proper caching headers
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Enable gzip/brotli compression
- [ ] Test production build locally

### Task 20: Final Performance Audit
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit after all optimizations
- [ ] Compare scores to baseline
- [ ] Document performance improvements
- [ ] Create performance optimization report
- [ ] Set up ongoing monitoring

## Success Metrics

Target improvements:
- LCP: Less than 2.5 seconds
- FID: Less than 100 milliseconds
- CLS: Less than 0.1
- Bundle Size: Reduce by 50 percent or more
- Lighthouse Score: 90 or higher on all metrics

## Maintenance Tasks

- [ ] Set up monthly performance audits
- [ ] Create performance regression tests
- [ ] Document performance best practices
- [ ] Train on performance-first development
- [ ] Regular dependency audits

## Implementation Notes

1. Complete tasks in order for best results
2. Measure performance after each major section
3. Document all changes for future reference
4. Test thoroughly on multiple devices
5. Verify no visual regressions occur
6. Keep design elements but optimize their loading and rendering
