# White Label Development Webpage Conversion Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan guides an AI agent to convert the current WordPress-focused white label development page to a modern tech stack-focused page, repositioning WordPress as a secondary service.

## IMPORTANT: Source Content Reference
**The new content for this page is stored in `white-label-page-content.md`**. The AI agent must use this file as the primary source for all text content updates. Do not create new content - copy directly from this file.

## Key Strategic Changes

1. **Primary Focus Shift**: From WordPress development to modern JavaScript/full-stack development
2. **Service Hierarchy**: Reorder services to lead with React/Node.js/JavaScript
3. **Messaging Update**: Change from "WordPress specialist" to "modern web development partner"
4. **Keyword Strategy**: Reduce WordPress mentions, increase JavaScript/React/Node.js references

## Content Orphan Management

### Content That Needs New Homes:

1. **WordPress Page Builder Expertise** (Currently detailed, needs new home)
   - **Solution**: Create a separate "WordPress Capabilities" page linked from main service
   - Or add collapsible section within WordPress service area

2. **WordPress-Specific Statistics** (40% of web, etc.)
   - **Solution**: Move to WordPress-specific section with context
   - Or remove entirely if not aligned with new positioning

3. **Detailed WordPress Multisite/Security Features**
   - **Solution**: Consolidate into brief bullets in WordPress section
   - Create detailed service pages for those who need specifics
