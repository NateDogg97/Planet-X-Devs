    id: 'faq-1',
    question: 'How quickly can you start on my project?',
    answer: 'For new clients, I can typically start within 3-5 business days. Retainer clients get priority scheduling and can have urgent requests addressed within 24-48 hours. Rush projects are available for an additional fee.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-2',
    question: 'Do you work directly with my clients?',
    answer: 'Never. This is a true white-label partnership. All communication goes through you, and all work is delivered under your agency\'s brand. Your clients will never know I exist unless you want them to.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-3',
    question: 'What if I need more hours than my plan includes?',
    answer: 'No problem! Additional hours are billed at $100/hour for all retainer clients. You can also upgrade your plan at any time, and unused hours roll over for up to 60 days.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-4',
    question: 'What platforms and technologies do you work with?',
    answer: 'I specialize in WordPress (including Elementor, Divi, and custom themes), React/Next.js applications, and popular e-commerce platforms like WooCommerce and Shopify. I also work with various page builders and can adapt to your preferred tech stack.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-5',
    question: 'How do you handle project communication and updates?',
    answer: 'I provide regular updates through your preferred channel (email, Slack, or project management tool). Retainer clients get weekly status reports, and all clients receive milestone updates throughout their projects.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-6',
    question: 'What\'s included in "website maintenance"?',
    answer: 'Maintenance includes security updates, plugin/theme updates, performance monitoring, regular backups, uptime monitoring, and minor content updates. For larger changes or new features, we\'ll use your retainer hours or quote separately.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-7',
    question: 'Do you offer any guarantees on your work?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. All development work comes with a 30-day bug-fix guarantee. If any issues arise from my code within 30 days of delivery, I\'ll fix them at no charge. I also guarantee on-time delivery or your project fee is reduced by 10%.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-8',
    question: 'Can you handle emergency fixes or urgent updates?',
    answer: 'Yes! Retainer clients have access to emergency support with 24-hour response times. For project-based clients, rush work is available at a 50% premium. I understand that sometimes things need to be fixed yesterday.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-9',
    question: 'Do you provide hosting services?',
    answer: 'While I don\'t provide hosting directly, I can recommend reliable hosting providers and handle all the technical setup. I\'ll also manage migrations, DNS configuration, and ensure optimal server settings for your sites.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-10',
    question: 'How do you handle revisions and feedback?',
    answer: 'Each project includes 2 rounds of revisions. I provide staging environments for review, and you can consolidate feedback from your clients before sending it to me. Additional revision rounds are billed hourly or can use retainer hours.'
